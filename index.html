		<h2 id="about-jenkins">Who is Ed Jenkins and why are his spindles so great?</h2>
		<p id="about-content">Ed Jenkinsâ€™ unique styles are based on the basic turkish spindle.<br>
		Ed applies creative innovations to his deep understanding of wood, gained through a lifetime
		passion for woodworking, to designing various styles and sizes, reinterpreting the ancient
		concept of a Turkish spindle with a focus on aesthetics and achieving the best spin possible. All
		the spindles are made using simple tools in his home shop in a small village tucked against the
		western foothills of the Cascade Mountains in N Oregon. Ed does not use any computerized machines
		or tools.<br>
		Ed fell in love with woodworking when he was a young boy and has been playing with wood ever
		since. Making spindles for people who are passionate about using excellent tools brings him great
		joy and satisfaction. He especially likes to use locally source woods such as Bigleaf Maple,
		boxwood, lilac and holly, as well as sustainably harvested woods from around the world.<br>
		Each spindle is gorgeous, unique and a joy to use. The sustained spin on Jenkins spindles lends
		itself to a relaxed and enjoyable spinning experience. You'll notice a difference in the quality
		of yarn you're able to create using one of his tools. So go ahead, pick up a Jenkins, take a
		breath and let yourself unwind while creating your art with his.<br></p>
